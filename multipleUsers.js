// Create an object in your JavaScript that holds an array of names (see example below).
var users = {
	names: ["Xavier", "Joanna", "Mackenzie", "Gunter", "Iveta", "Sven"];
};
// Next to the message input box, there should be a radio button group for each name in the list.
// When a user enters a message, it should be prepended with the chosen user's name, in bold text.
// Keep in mind that this will likely change the structure of your JSON file since the pre-loaded messages have to have this information on them.
